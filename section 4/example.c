        Introduction to data types and variables in C
        8 Bits = 1 Byte
        4 or 8 Bytes = 1 WORD

        Data Type - Identifier - Value (Literal; Fixed value)
        int         boys       = 15;

        Data Type also decides how much space the variable will take in memory.
        Variable naming rules: 
            1. Only letters, upper and lower case, digits ranging from 0 to 9 and underscores.
            2. The first character cant be a digit.
            3. Avoid starting the name with an underscore.

        Fundamental Data Types in C:
        Numbers: 78, 3.14
        Characters: 'A'

        Derived Data Types in C:
        Strings: "Hello World" (collection of characters)
        Array: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'] (collection of data type, for example string)
        Complex types: struct, pointers, etc.
